# Predict the quality of freshwater - INTEL ONEAPLI HACKATHON PROJECT

Freshwater is one of our most vital and scarce natural resources, making up just 3% of the earthâ€™s total water volume. It touches nearly every aspect of our daily lives, from drinking, swimming, and bathing to generating food, electricity, and the products we use every day. Access to a safe and sanitary water supply is essential not only to human life, but also to the survival of surrounding ecosystems that are experiencing the effects of droughts, pollution, and rising temperatures.
